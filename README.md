# Biostatistics Project: Randomized Phase III Study of Panitumumab with FOLFOX4 for First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

**Authors:** Lucia Maninetti, Arianna Rigamonti, Michele Sala, Jacopo Tettamanti

This repository contains code and data related to a randomized phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Below is a brief overview of the study and the contents of this repository.

## Abstract

The study, named the Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy (PRIME), aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of panitumumab-FOLFOX4 combination therapy compared to FOLFOX4 alone as initial treatment for mCRC. Key findings include significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with wild-type (WT) KRAS tumors treated with panitumumab-FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone. This README provides an overview of the statistical analysis conducted on the trial data.
